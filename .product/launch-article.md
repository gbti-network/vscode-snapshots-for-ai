# Announcing Snapshots for AI: Now Available for VS Code!

## The Challenge of LLM Context Management

![LLM Context Management](screenshots/screenshot-1.png)

Picture this: You're deep in the trenches of a complex project, working alongside your AI assistant. As the hours tick by, you notice your AI companion starting to fumble - suggesting solutions you've already tried, referencing outdated code, or even proposing changes that would reintroduce previously fixed bugs. This is the harsh reality of LLM context loss.

## The Rise of Flowstate Code Editors

![Flowstate Editors](screenshots/screenshot-2.png)

The development landscape is undergoing a significant transformation with the emergence of AI-powered flowstate code editors. Tools like Cursor have pioneered this space, while newcomers like Windsurf and Cognition Labs' Devin are pushing the boundaries even further. These editors are redefining how developers interact with their code, offering seamless AI integration and context-aware assistance.

## Snapshots for AI: Bridging the Context Gap

While true Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems offer powerful capabilities, they often require complex infrastructure and can be costly to implement. Snapshots for AI takes a different approach, providing a lightweight yet effective solution for maintaining LLM context in development workflows.

Our approach is simple but powerful: generate clean, well-structured markdown snapshots of your code that can be directly fed to any LLM. This gives you:

- **Selective Context Control**: Choose exactly which files and code segments to include, avoiding the overhead of processing entire codebases
- **Universal Compatibility**: Works with any LLM service - from ChatGPT to Claude to local models
- **Cost-Effective Implementation**: No need for expensive API calls or complex vector databases
- **Immediate Integration**: Start using it immediately with your existing LLM tools and workflows

## Why Markdown Matters

![Markdown Benefits](screenshots/screenshot-4.png)

In the world of LLM-assisted development, the choice of format for context sharing is crucial. Markdown has emerged as the ideal medium for several compelling reasons:

### Universal Readability
- Human-readable while maintaining structure
- Supported by virtually all LLMs
- Preserves code formatting and syntax highlighting

### Context Preservation
- Maintains file relationships and project structure
- Supports hierarchical organization
- Allows for inline documentation and metadata

### Optimal Token Usage
- Efficient representation of code context
- Minimal overhead compared to other formats
- Better token economy for API-based LLM interactions

## Practical Use Cases

Snapshots for AI shines in various development scenarios:

### Debugging Unfamiliar Languages
When working with a new language or framework, provide your AI assistant with precise context about compile errors and implementation details.

### Long-Running Development Sessions
Start fresh AI sessions without losing context - quickly bring your AI assistant up to speed with your current environment and code state.

### Code Refactoring and Improvement
Partner with your AI assistant for both quick development of small applications and thoughtful refactoring of larger codebases.

### Documentation and Knowledge Transfer
Create clear, context-rich documentation for team members or future reference, with all relevant code relationships preserved.

## Introducing the VS Code Extension

## From PhpStorm to VS Code: A Seamless Transition

With the incredible support of Windsurf, we've transformed our Java-based [PhpStorm plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/24889-snapshots-for-ai) into a TypeScript-powered VS Code extension. The transition was remarkably smooth, allowing us to maintain all the core functionality while adapting to VS Code's ecosystem.

## Powered by TypeScript and Windsurf

The conversion from Java to TypeScript wasn't just a technical necessity - it was an opportunity to enhance and streamline our codebase. Windsurf's expertise in TypeScript and VS Code extension development made this transition seamless and efficient.

## Integration with Open VSX Registry and Windsurf IDE

We're particularly excited about our integration with Windsurf through the Open VSX Registry. Our extension is now available at [open-vsx.org/extension/GBTI/snapshots-for-ai](https://open-vsx.org/extension/GBTI/snapshots-for-ai), making it seamlessly accessible to Windsurf users. This integration is especially meaningful as Windsurf leverages the Open VSX Registry to curate its marketplace of available extensions.

## Embracing Open Source

We've removed all freemium restrictions, making the VS Code extension completely free. This decision reflects our understanding that in a world where premium AI-powered editors are becoming the norm, developers shouldn't have to pay extra for supplementary RAG tools.

## Supporting the Community Through Sponsorship

Instead of charging for premium features, we've added a sponsors button that allows users to support the GBTI network in various ways, aligning with the true spirit of open source collaboration.

## Source Code and Documentation

You can find the source code for both versions on GitHub:
- [VS Code Extension](https://github.com/gbti-network/vscode-snapshots-for-ai)
- [PhpStorm Plugin](https://github.com/gbti-network/phpstorm-snapshots-for-ai)

## Configuration and Support

The extension is highly configurable through `.snapshots/config.json`, allowing you to customize:
- Default prompts
- Project structure inclusion
- File patterns to include/exclude
- And more!

For support or to report issues:
- Visit our [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/gbti-network/vscode-snapshots-for-ai/issues)
- Join our community discussions
